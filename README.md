This repo holds source files for our COSC 3380 - Database Systems project. 

## Project Description
Our team was tasked to develop a SQL database and accompanying web application (HTML/CSS/Node.js) for the Musuem of Fine Arts Houston (MFAH). The SQL database stores information about art works owned by the museum, special exhibitions hosted by the museum, visitor login information, and employee login information. The intention is for any user, be it a visitor or employee, to access the database contents through the web application. 

Based on the type of user, only relevant content will be served. For example, a visitor can only search art works and purchase exhibition tickets. An employee will be able to alter the art work descriptions.
